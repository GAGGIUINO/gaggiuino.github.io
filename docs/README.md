> This site is a general guide and not a exhaustive, step-by-step tutorial, it is expected that anyone attempting the project has basic proficiency with the skills listed in the [Recommendations](learning/learning-sources.md) page. For anyone attempting the install it's strongly recommended to read the install route in it's entirety and plan accordingly.

> __1. Failing to run the right code branch on the chosen set of hardware will yield unexpected results.__   
> __2. Make sure you _ALWAYS_ flash both the microcontroller as well as the LCD unit.__   
> __3. Arduino Nano won't flash with the LCD attached to the RX/TX pins so make sure to disconnect it at that time.__

# Timeline

<details>
<summary><b>Initial checks</b> <i>(Click to expand)</i></summary>


1. Purchase the parts listed from Ali and expect a wait of ~1 month.

   Any parts purchased anywhere else are done so at your own risk (they've not been tested).

2. Connect test components described in the doc to Arduino.

   Using the expansion board, twist the ends of cables and connect to the screw terminals. At this point using DuPont connections is fine but please note later we will solder to the boards or pins.

3. Flash Arduino and LCD with code.

4. Plug in and test.

   Check for a temp reading. It will contain the default offset of 7 degrees which means the initial temp will be room temp -7.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Base Install</b> <i>(Click to expand)</i></summary>

1. Plan out where the components will sit inside the machine to determine cable length
2. Create piggyback cables. Determine what switch points to piggyback from.
3. Wire in power delivery method - isolate the board using an enclosure or tape it up after wiring.
4. If you have the eco timer, disable it.
5. Swap out thermocouple - ease out the boiler (don't fully remove it) in order to gain more access.
6. Install the max temp board - isolate the board using an enclosure or tape it up after wiring.
7. Place and wire relay - attach the brew thermostat wires to the SSR relay and sit/attach the back plate or relay on the body of the machine, add some thermal paste
8. Re-Wire the steam switch for steam handling - you need to swap the brew thermostat wires (above step) for the steam thermostat wires and bridge the brew thermostat wires together then take some wires from the steam switch to the Arduino.
9. Wire brew switch for continuity
10. Test.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Extended Install</b> <i>(Click to expand)</i></summary>

1. Install the pressure sensor. Ensure it does not leak under pressure.
2. Install dimmer - isolate the board using an enclosure or tape it up after wiring.
3. Install the load cells.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Final checks</b> <i>(Click to expand)</i></summary>

1. Make sure all connections are proper i.e., no metal is exposed and well isolated, all soldering is perfect and wrapped in heat-shrink.
2. Flash the Arduino and LCD with the latest version from GitHub (there could have been changes since).
3. Record your first start. Post this to [#first-start](https://discord.com/channels/890339612441063494/919183771079692328) on Discord.
4. Find out your regional settings and set them in the settings of the Arduino.
5. Check all other settings save correctly.
6. Record your first shot. Post this to [#first-shot](https://discord.com/channels/890339612441063494/910972035205857320) on Discord.

> This is not necessarily an exhaustive list. You may need additional tools depending on your specific install. Please refrain from asking for references: use common sense, and search the Discord server for existing recommendations.

* Soldering: iron, solder, flux, wick, third-hand tool
* Multimeter - for continuity testing
* Thermal paste - for thermocouple
* Crimp pliers, wire stripper/cutter
* Strip board or WAGO connectors - for lego build
* Fork connectors - for SSR
* Heat shrink, heat-resistant electrical tape

# 3D Printed Parts
> [!Tip]
> If you prefer to purchase printed parts the oficially approved providers in the __Approved Official Suppliers__ sidebar section use recommended materials and print settings.

_BOM and assembly instructions for the 3D printed parts are linked here._  
If you'd like to print yourself, order from CraftCloud, or use a local print shop please carefully review the recommended print parameters on the design pages.

### Hardware Scales Functionality
> [!Tip]
> The STM32 build has software emulated **predictive scales** enabled that are sufficient for users with performed calibration. Same as hardware scales predictive ones try to offer accurate sensing of the first drops into the cup as well as realtime shot weight tracking and stop-on-weight across a variety of settings and less traditional shot profiles but it's not fool proof or able to cater for the more advanced minds out there, if extreme experimentation is your fetish it's advised to use hw scales instead.

> [!WARNING]
> This is an advanced installation step that requires accurate 3D-printed parts, good installation practices, and an in-depth understanding to achieve optimal results.
