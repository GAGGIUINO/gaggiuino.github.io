> We want to bring your attention to an important issue that affects the sustainability of the project. We've noticed that some bad actors are taking advantage of our hard work and dedication for their own financial benefit. Buying PCBs, kits, or 3D prints from unauthorized sources directly supports these profit-driven individuals, undermining the very core ideas and values that our mod stands for.
>
> We are committed to sticking to our principles and keeping the community strong. We have consciously chosen not to commercialize the project, allowing it to remain open and accessible to all. Therefore, we urge you to pause and think twice before making any purchases from websites that are not officially approved and listed on the left side menu.
>
> Instead, we encourage you to support our officially approved suppliers who are dedicated to upholding our mod's principles and ensuring top-notch quality. By doing so, you not only help us maintain the integrity of the project but also show your support for the countless hours of work invested by our team and contributors.

# Compatibility

Gaggiuino is designed for the Gaggia Classic family of espresso machines with 3-way valves (**NOT the Gaggia Classic V2, SIN035U RI9403**). Other espresso machines such as the Rancilio Silvia are also supported although no official installation instructions are available at this time.

# Build Process

> [!TIP|style:callout|label:WHERE TO GO FOR HELP|iconVisibility:visible]
> If you need help (even during the planning phase) please make **one** [Discord](community/community-media.md#community-discord) help thread in [#install-help-gc](https://discord.com/channels/890339612441063494/996814638471708683) (for Gaggia Classic) or [#install-help-gcp](https://discord.com/channels/890339612441063494/996188987964268555) (for Gaggia Classic Pro/Eco/Evo).  
> Title the thread by *[username][machine type][control system] Thread Title* and include any links/pictures/videos that may apply to your question. As you have more questions, rename the *Thread Title* and add your question to the thread.  
> ***One help thread per person/machine, please!***

1. **Identify your espresso machine (or determine what to buy)**

  See the [Compatibility Table](#compatibility)

2. **Determine your build path.** 

  Decide if you're going to order a [PCB](pcb/singleboard.md) or build a [component (Lego)](guides-stm32/lego-component-build-guide.md) control system. In general the PCB is going to be much simpler, while the component build is more flexible for experimentation and less picky about thermocouples but requires significant wiring and soldering. 

  Decide how to integrate the control system with your espresso machine. It can either be [integrated into the stock wiring](guides-stm32/3pln-stock-wiring-integration.md) with a few jumpers (less wiring, but sometimes more confusing) or the stock wiring can be replaced with a [custom wiring harness](guides-stm32/3pln-custom-wiring.md) (more work, but results in a clean, straightforward install). It is recommended that you check the notes in the [Compatibility Table](#compatibility) for your machine and and read through the instructions before deciding.

3. **Select and Order Components**

  Order components based on your machine and install path. Make sure to check the [Bill of Materials](#bill-of-materials), the [custom wiring page](guides-stm32/3pln-custom-wiring.md) (if that's the route you're going), and the pages of any optional accessories ([HW Scales](accessories/hw-scales.md), [ToFnLED](accessories/tofnled.md)) that you'd like to install. 

  There are approved official suppliers for PCBs and Kits, and 3D printed parts linked in the sidebar. Select the 3D print provider closest to you for the lowest shipping cost. Alternatively, the BOM has sources linked so you can order components yourself and 3D print from the design files.

  > [!TIP|style:callout|label:NAMING TIP|iconVisibility:visible]
  > There are two main groups of Gaggia Classic espresso machines referred to in the BOM and instructions:  
  >   - Gaggia Classic (GC)  
  >   - Gaggia Classic Pro (GCP), which generally includes the Pro, Eco, and Evo models

4. **Parts are in, time to build!**

  > [!WARNING|style:callout|label:WARNING ABOUT VIDEOS|iconVisibility:visible]
  > There are no official build videos. It is highly recommended to only follow the instructions on this website.

  Follow the instructions for your control system selection

BOM and assembly instructions for the recommended 3D printed parts used in the standard install are linked here.  

<!-- tabs:start -->
<!-- tab:STM32 PCB -->

<!-- tabs:end -->

If you'd like to print yourself, order from CraftCloud, or use a local print shop **please carefully review the recommended print parameters** on the design pages. 

Additional Gaggiuino models can be found in the [Gaggiuino Model Collection](https://www.printables.com/social/340492-loogle/collections/265668) or on [Discord](community/community-media.md#community-discord) in the **#mod-3d-design-ideas** channel.

# Accessories

Accessories can be added to the base Gaggiuino build for additional features. BOM and instructions are linked below. 

* [Hardware Scales](accessories/hw-scales.md) sit below the drip tray and measure weight during shots. They're most useful for those who like to experiment with beans, grind, and profiles where predictive scales may have a difficult time
* [ToFnLED](accessories/tofnled.md) provides an RGB LED and sensor for measuring water tank level
