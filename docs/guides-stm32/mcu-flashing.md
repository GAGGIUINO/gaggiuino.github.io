# MCU Flashing

## Software Prerequisites:
1. Install/Update [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Install/Update [Platform IO](https://platformio.org/) 
3. Install [Git](https://www.git-scm.com/)
4. Install [STM32 Cube Programmer](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeprog.html)

Then pull the code as shown in the below video:

</details>

Make sure to switch to the necessary [release branch](#Releases) once pulled, depending on the target platform (nano or STM32). For STM32 the recommended upload method is by using a physical ST-Link or WeAct Mini Debugger.

# Flashing

## STM32 / Blackpill
  
Make sure you have necessary [Software Prerequisites](#software-prerequisites) installed, and any applicable extra defines entered and saved in `extra_defines.ini` before starting. Do not have STM32 Cube Programmer open if uploading via VS Code.

>[!Tip]
>extra_defines.ini is used for accessories and other special functions. You do not need one for the base install.

1. Select the environment based on the upload method:
    - **Lego** if you have individual components, **PCB** if you have one.
    - **forced-predictive** if you don't have hardware scales
    - **STlink** if you are using an ST-Link or the WeAct Mini Debugger, **DFU** if not (deprecated).
2. Click "Build" in VSCode (PlatformIO tab)

3. Connect the PCBv3.1 or Blackpill to the WeAct Mini Debugger or ST-Link<sup>1</sup> (connect 3.3V<sup>2</sup>, SWDIO, SWCLK, and GND)

4. Make sure the Blackpill/PCBv3.1 USB-C is **not** connected to anything
5. Connect ST-Link/WeAct Mini Debugger USB to the computer
6. Click Upload in VS Code (PlatformIO tab)
7. Wait until you see green/success logs

> [!Note|style:callout]
> *1 Pins should be on the back of the Blackpill for PCBv3 compatibility*  
> *2 Some ST-Links may have issues if 3.3V is connected and the system is powered through the 120/220 VAC PSU when flashing. If unsure about your ST-Link, only connect 3.3V if you'll turn off or disconnect AC power before flashing.*

## Nextion/TJC display

Flashing instructions:
1. On an otherwise-empty â‰¤32 GB FAT32 microSD card, copy the applicable *Brand*-*Type*-lcd.tft  
    - Brand: nextion or tjc  
    - Type: basic or discovery (Nextion Orange PCB)

  > [!Tip|label:Scales Calibration Files|style:callout]
  > Display files for scales calibration are in the "scales-calibration" folder
  
2. While **powered off**, put the microSD card in the display
3. Power on the display. When not installed in the machine, power for flashing may be provided through the USB-C port on the Blackpill/PCB. Use a USB power adapter rated for 5 VDC and 500+ mA.  
> [!Note|style:callout]
> Make sure the ST-Link is disconnected. Don't use it, a battery bank, or PC USB ports for power).  
4. Wait for the display to show the "Update Successed! (sic)" message, turn off power, and then remove the microSD card.
