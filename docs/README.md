> 1. Failing to run the right code branch on the chosen set of hardware will yield unexpected results.
>
> 2. Make sure you **ALWAYS** flash both the microcontroller as well as the LCD unit.

!> Arduino Nano won't flash with the LCD attached to the RX/TX pins so make sure to disconnect it at that time.

<summary><b>MOD FUNCTIONS AND USAGE</b> <i>(Click to expand)</i></summary>

 - **BOILER**: Sets the desired temperature at the boiler level
 - **OFFSET**: Sets the offset value used to calculate the real water temperature
 - **HPWR**: Sets the relay start pulse length
 - **M.C.DIV**: Sets the main cycle divider (aka non brew heating behaviour), used in conjunction with HPWR
 - **B.C.DIV**: Sets the brew cycle divider
 - **Brew(Auto)**: All pressure settings are following the below:
   - **PREINFUSION**: Enables pre-infusion
     - **Time**: Sets the length of the PI phase
     - **Bar**: Sets the max reachable pressure for the PI phase
     - **Soak**: Sets the length of the soaking (blooming) phase
   - **P-PROFILING**: Enables AUTO pressure profiling mode
     - **Start**: Sets the desired starting point of the PP phase, can be High->Low or Low->High.
     - **Finish**: Sets the desired finish point of the PP phase, same as above can be from High->Low or Low->High.
     - **Hold**: Sets the length of the PP hold period, if it's desired to maintain the "Start" pressure for a period of time before the pressure drop/raise is applied this is where it's done.
     - **Length**: Sets the length (AKA speed) of the PP drop/raise behaviour, so one can change the pressure slow or fast if desired.

 - **Brew(Manual)**: Allows for manual pressure control at brew time.
 - **DESCALE**: Enables the descaling program.

  >Descaling should be done with a blind basket portafilter locked in the group, steam valve slightly open for the water to flow in a separate reservoir and water tank fully loaded with water mixed with descale solution.

## Timeline

<details>
<summary><b>Initial checks</b> <i>(Click to expand)</i></summary>


1. Purchase the parts listed from Ali and expect a wait of ~1 month.

   Any parts purchased anywhere else are done so at your own risk (they've not been tested).

2. Connect test components described in the doc to Arduino.

   Using the expansion board, twist the ends of cables and connect to the screw terminals. At this point using DuPont connections is fine but please note later we will solder to the boards or pins.

3. Flash Arduino and LCD with code.

4. Plug in and test.

   Check for a temp reading. It will contain the default offset of 7 degrees which means the initial temp will be room temp -7.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Base Install</b> <i>(Click to expand)</i></summary>

1. Plan out where the components will sit inside the machine to determine cable length
2. Create piggyback cables. Determine what switch points to piggyback from.
3. Wire in power delivery method - isolate the board using an enclosure or tape it up after wiring.
4. If you have the eco timer, disable it.
5. Swap out thermocouple - ease out the boiler (don't fully remove it) in order to gain more access.
6. Install the max temp board - isolate the board using an enclosure or tape it up after wiring.
7. Place and wire relay - attach the brew thermostat wires to the SSR relay and sit/attach the back plate or relay on the body of the machine, add some thermal paste
8. Re-Wire the steam switch for steam handling - you need to swap the brew thermostat wires (above step) for the steam thermostat wires and bridge the brew thermostat wires together then take some wires from the steam switch to the Arduino.
9. Wire brew switch for continuity
10. Test.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Extended Install</b> <i>(Click to expand)</i></summary>

1. Install the pressure sensor. Ensure it does not leak under pressure.
2. Install dimmer - isolate the board using an enclosure or tape it up after wiring.
3. Install the load cells.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Final checks</b> <i>(Click to expand)</i></summary>

1. Make sure all connections are proper i.e., no metal is exposed and well isolated, all soldering is perfect and wrapped in heat-shrink.
2. Flash the Arduino and LCD with the latest version from GitHub (there could have been changes since).
3. Record your first start. Post this to [#first-start](https://discord.com/channels/890339612441063494/919183771079692328) on Discord.
4. Find out your regional settings and set them in the settings of the Arduino.
5. Check all other settings save correctly.
6. Record your first shot. Post this to [#first-shot](https://discord.com/channels/890339612441063494/910972035205857320) on Discord.

  * [5V RELAY](https://a.aliexpress.com/_vpUdrT) **Supersedes the 1-bit opto**
  
_It is optional, but highly recommended, to purchase an ST-Link V2 to program the STM32 because the STM32 boot button often fails_

  * [ST-Link V2](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256801435312142.html) **DO NOT BUY THE STM32 FROM THIS LINK. ONLY THE ST-LINK V2**

  !>Due to global shortages the semiconductors sector was hit hard, as a result STM32 chips are quite hard to obtain, be wary of resources selling fakes or low quality clones which will lead to either bad experience or no experience.
  If the reccommended seller doesn't have it in stock you will have to shop around.

* **SCALES:**

_Will enable for realtime shot weight tracking without external scales, be aware this is a highly advanced installation step and requires in depth understanding to achieve optimal results, it can't be simplified due to the higly sensitive nature scales require in terms of both installation as well as various tolerances._
